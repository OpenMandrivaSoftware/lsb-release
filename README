LSB version query program (lsb_release) by Dominique Massonie
(mdomi@users.sourceforge.net)

This program forms part of the required functionality of the LSB
(Linux Standard Base) specification.

The program queries the installed state of the distribution to display
certain properties such as the version of the LSB against which the
distribution claims compliance as well. It can also attempt to display
the name and release of the distribution along with an identifier of
who produces the distribution.

======================================================================

Note that this is an \example/ implementation.  

The specification requires only an lsb_release command to exist, and to
return the information in the format described.  The fact that the manual
page generated from this software describes implementation details of this
example should not be construed as placing any additional requirements
on implementors beyond those just noted.  In particular, the existance and
format of the /etc/lsb-release file and the /etc/lsb-release.d directory
are not part of the LSB specification
